# Eleana

**Eleana** is a free software application for analyzing and modifying spectra from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometers. Originally developed in **LabVIEW**, it is now being completely rewritten in **Python** for better flexibility and broader accessibility. 

Eleana supports direct data import from **Bruker** spectrometers (ESP300E, EMX, ElexSys) and is available for any system running **Python**

The software is freely available for scientific and educational use, while commercial use requires authorization.
